Important note: this is __NOT A REAL PROGRAM__! This has been made, works and will work only in the game called Grey Hack!


## Objectives

## Features

There are some of the features of Process Monitor:

- Manipulation: Choose processes you want to manipulate on. Currently, you can kill processes and take snapshots of them running
- Configuration: Edit the program's configuration via configuration menu or directly via changing .conf file
- User Themes: Edit look-and-feel of the program

... and more coming soon!
